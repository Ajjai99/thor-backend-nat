# DB bootstrap (Master migrations + roles)

The Master DB schema and the least-privilege database roles the platform assumes at runtime are
both created by the **`Thor.DbBootstrap` Lambda** (`backend/functions/Thor.DbBootstrap`), not by
a manual SQL run. Terraform's `db_bootstrap` module (`infra/src/modules/db_bootstrap`) deploys
that Lambda in-VPC and invokes it at `apply` (via `aws_lambda_invocation`). Each invocation first
applies the `MasterDbContext` EF Core migrations (`backend/shared/Thor.DataLayer/Migrations/Master`),
then runs the embedded role/grant script (`.../Thor.DbBootstrap.Function/db-roles.sql`). There is
**no** checked-in SQL to run by hand and **no** out-of-band step.

| Role | Purpose | Grants |
|------|---------|--------|
| `thor_provisioner` | Tenant-provisioning **DDL only** (create-tenant-database step) | `LOGIN CREATEDB CREATEROLE`, `rds_iam WITH ADMIN OPTION` |
| `thor_metadata_writer` | Write tenant metadata (seed + finalize-routing steps) | `LOGIN`, `rds_iam`, write on the two `auth` tables, read on `master` |
| `thor_app` | Runtime read of tenant routing | `LOGIN`, `rds_iam`, read on `auth` + `master` |
| `thor_authorizer` | Authorizer's user-pool/tenant-id → routing lookup (in-VPC, IAM via the RDS Proxy) | `LOGIN`, `rds_iam`, read on `auth.tenant` + `auth.tenant_routing` |

**Every role uses RDS IAM auth — there is no password anywhere.** The authorizer now runs in-VPC
and connects through the RDS Proxy with an IAM token as `thor_authorizer` (the RDS Data API is
disabled, `enable_http_endpoint = false`). Per-tenant `tenant_<id>_rw`/`_ro` roles are created
later by the provisioning workflow, not here.

## How it runs

- **Master credentials, in-VPC only.** The bootstrap Lambda is the *only* place the AWS-managed
  Aurora master credential is used. It reads that secret (by ARN) through the Secrets Manager VPC
  interface endpoint and opens **one** direct connection to the Aurora writer as master. Nothing
  outside the VPC ever touches the DB.
- **Idempotent + self-triggering.** `MigrateAsync` applies only the migrations missing from
  `master.__EFMigrationsHistory`; the embedded script uses `DO`-block existence checks for the
  roles and `to_regclass(...)` guards for the table/schema grants. Both halves are safe to re-run.
  The `aws_lambda_invocation` re-triggers on the Lambda's `source_code_hash`, so any change to the
  roles/grants redeploys and re-applies automatically on the next `apply`.

## Migration ordering

Migrations run **before** the role script within the same invocation, so on a brand-new cluster a
single `apply` yields the schema, the roles, and the table grants (which are guarded on
`auth.tenant` / `auth.tenant_routing` existing). The publish hook hashes each function's own `src/`
plus all of `backend/shared/` (see `scripts/publish-lambda-functions.sh`), so a new Master
migration in `Thor.DataLayer` alone rebuilds this Lambda, which changes its `source_code_hash` and
re-invokes it on the next `apply`. No edit under `Thor.DbBootstrap/src` is needed.
