# Catch-all proxy — forwards every path/method through the VPC Link to the NLB, which forwards to
# thor. The stage (deployment.tf) is named, not $default, so it's a real leading path segment on
# every request that reaches this API — including through CloudFront, whose origin_path (cdn.tf)
# prepends it to every request regardless of environment. thor.api's own routing knows nothing
# about API Gateway stages, so request_parameters rewrites the outgoing path to strip it before
# forwarding (e.g. "/dev/v1/orders" -> "/v1/orders").
#
# Two integrations, not one, because the rewrite expression differs per route: the proxy route's
# $request.path.proxy only resolves against its own {proxy+} capture, and referencing it from the
# root route (which has no such parameter) is invalid.
