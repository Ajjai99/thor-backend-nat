# Workflows live in this state alongside the platform. They were briefly split into their own
# Terraform states; that was reverted once the image tag stopped being Terraform's business, because
# the only thing the split bought was stopping an image deploy from applying unrelated platform
# drift — and an image deploy no longer applies anything at all. See modules/workflow's image_tag.
#
# The platform half (ECR repository, security group, shared cluster) is still its own set of modules
# taking a plain list of names. rds_proxy and neptune build their ingress rules from
# module.workflow_network rather than from a workflow, so nothing about a workflow's own resources
# can feed back into the platform.
