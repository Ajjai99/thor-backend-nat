    This is a plaintext variable rather than a secret reference for two reasons. Lambda
    environment variables have no valueFrom indirection, so Terraform would have to read the
    secret at apply time via aws_secretsmanager_secret_version — which writes the whole secret,
    private half included, into state. And the value is public by design: the authorizer only
    ever verifies connector tokens, and only Thor.Api can mint them (ADR §5.2).

    MUST match the "public_key" field of thor-<environment>-secret-connector-jwt. Rotating the
    keypair means updating both, or the authorizer will reject tokens Thor.Api considers valid.
    scripts/seed-connector-secrets.sh keeps the two in step; see
    infra/bootstrap/connector-secrets.md.

    Defaults to "" only to break a bootstrap cycle: this module creates the secret the keypair
    lives in, so on a brand-new environment there is nothing to generate the key from until
    after the first apply. The authorizer stays broken (as it is today) until the second apply
    picks the seeded key up — it is not a value to leave empty on purpose.
