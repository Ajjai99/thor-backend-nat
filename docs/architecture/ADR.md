## 1. Overview

Thor is a **multi-tenant Identity Hygiene SaaS platform**, cloud-native and
deployed on AWS. It ingests identity data from customer environments (on-prem
and cloud), detects what has changed via Change Data Capture, and runs business
workflows to identify accounts, violations, and hygiene issues.

Core design principles:

1. **Tenant isolation by default** — every data path must resolve tenant from a
   *trusted* source and must fail closed if the tenant cannot be verified.
2. **Never trust spoofable input** — subdomains, headers, file paths, and API
   keys are only ever *hints*; the authoritative binding always comes from the
   tenant metadata store or a cryptographically verified token.
3. **Consistent, composable workflows** — every business process is an
   independent module built to a common pattern so new processes are additive.
4. **Elastic path from single-cluster to cluster-pool** — the platform starts on
   one shared data cluster and scales to many clusters by data (routing), not by
   re-architecture.

## 2. Tech Stack

- **Frontend:** Vue (latest) + TypeScript + Vite. Static SPA served from S3 via
  CloudFront.
- **Backend:**
  - **Thor API** (internet-facing API layer): C# / .NET 10.
  - **Task API** (internal task/workflow control API): C# / .NET 10.
  - **Workflow Tasks** (compute for business processes): C# / .NET 10.
  - **Intelligence Engine** (AI): Python + LangChain + AWS Bedrock.
- **Infrastructure:** Terraform.

## 3. This Repository

This is a **mono-repo** containing all **backend** and **infrastructure** code.
It does **not** contain connector code or frontend code (those live in their own
repos).

## 4. Networking & Edge

Ingress path for user/API traffic:

```
Client → Route 53 → CloudFront (+ WAF) → API Gateway → VPC Link → NLB → Thor API (ECS)
```

- **Thor API is the only internet-facing service.** All other services are
  private and are only reachable by Thor API (or by internal orchestration).
- **Per-tenant subdomains** (`<tenant>.thor.example.com`) resolve via Route 53 to
  a single CloudFront distribution using a **wildcard certificate**
  (`*.thor.example.com`) and wildcard alternate domain name.
- **WAF is attached at CloudFront** (edge). Managed rule groups + rate-based
  rules; see §9 for per-tenant throttling.
- **API Gateway reaches Thor API through a VPC Link → private NLB.** There is no
  ALB: all traffic terminates at the single Thor API service, so L7 host/path
  routing (the reason to use an ALB) is unnecessary. API Gateway already handles
  routing and authorization, and WAF is at CloudFront, so an NLB (L4) is the
  right, cheaper fit. The NLB stays in a private subnet.
- **API Gateway is a deliberate choice** (not a redundant hop): it lets us wire
  authentication at the edge — a **Cognito authorizer** for user traffic and a
  **Lambda authorizer** for API-key (connector) traffic — so unauthenticated
  requests never reach the NLB or Thor API. See §5.

**Frontend** is served as static assets from a private S3 bucket via a
CloudFront origin (OAC), separate from the API origin.

**Decision: browsers call the API same-origin; there is no CORS.** The frontend
distribution routes `<tenant>.<domain>/api/*` to API Gateway (caching off, all
viewer headers but `Host` forwarded, `/api` stripped by a CloudFront Function),
so the SPA's API calls are same-origin: no CORS and no preflight. API Gateway
has no CORS configuration, so browser code on any other origin can't read API
responses; cross-origin browser access is unsupported by design. Non-browser
clients (connectors) keep using `api.<domain>` (the API's own distribution);
CORS never applies to them. Consequences:
- SPA routing (unknown path → `index.html`) is a CloudFront Function on the SPA
  behavior only, never a distribution-wide custom error response, which would
  turn the API's own 403/404s into a 200 `index.html`.
- Both distributions' WAFs screen API traffic, so their rules must agree (e.g.
  the 8 KB body limit and its IdP-metadata exception).
- Local frontend development reaches the API through a dev-server proxy.

### 4.1 Connector data-plane path

On-prem and cloud connectors do **not** stream file bytes through the API. They:

1. Authenticate to **Thor API** (API-key path, §5.1) and request a presigned
   S3 URL.
2. Upload file bytes **directly to S3** using the presigned URL.

Consequences:
- The upload data-plane **bypasses CloudFront/WAF/API Gateway** by design. The
  compensating controls are: presigned URLs are short-lived, prefix-scoped, and
  size/content-type constrained (§5.2); the bucket enforces TLS-only and blocks
  public access; uploaded objects are treated as untrusted until validated.

## 5. Authentication, Authorization & Tenant Resolution

### 5.1 Identities & edge authorization

Authentication is enforced at **API Gateway (REST API)** so unauthenticated
traffic never reaches the NLB or Thor API:

- **Users** authenticate via **Amazon Cognito** (one user pool per tenant; local
  users and/or the tenant's federated SAML/OIDC IdPs). The token's issuer names
  the tenant's pool, and `auth.tenant_routing.user_pool_id` is unique, so the
  pool maps back to exactly one tenant.
- **Connectors / external services** authenticate with an **API key**, validated
  by a **Lambda authorizer** (REST API, `REQUEST` type) that verifies the hashed
  key against the **Master metadata DB** (§5.2) and takes the tenant from the
  key's stored binding before the request is forwarded.
- **Before sign-in**, the SPA calls the unauthenticated
  `GET /v1/login-config/{subdomain}` to learn which pool/app client to use, the
  pool's Cognito domain, and the names of the tenant's federated IdPs. These
  are public values, and the subdomain here is a discovery hint only: it grants
  nothing. The IdP list is read from the app client and cached per pool, so
  anonymous traffic can't fan out into Cognito calls.
- **Federated sign-in (SSO).** Tenant provisioning gives every pool a Cognito
  prefix domain (`thor-<env>-<subdomain>`, stored as
  `auth.tenant_routing.cognito_domain`) and enables the OAuth authorization-code
  flow on its app client, with callback/logout URLs on the tenant's SPA host.
  The SPA sends a user to `/oauth2/authorize?identity_provider=<name>` on that
  domain, which redirects straight to the tenant's IdP. Re-running provisioning
  for an existing tenant backfills the domain and OAuth settings (every step is
  idempotent and additive).
- **Self-service IdP setup.** The tenant's admin (Cognito `admins` group)
  configures SAML/OIDC IdPs through `/v1/identity-providers`. Cognito holds every
  IdP setting and secret. Thor keeps one non-secret row per IdP in
  `auth.tenant_identity_provider`: whether it's enabled, the admin's vendor label
  (`entra`, `okta`, `ping`, `google`, `adfs`, `other`), which SAML source it came
  from, and who created/last changed it. A SAML IdP can be given as a metadata
  URL, a metadata file, or entity ID + SSO URL + signing certificate, from which
  Thor builds the metadata document. OIDC client secrets are never returned, and
  a blank secret on update keeps the current one.
  `GET /v1/sso/service-provider` returns what the admin enters in their IdP
  (SP entity ID, ACS/redirect URLs, Cognito's signing certificate).
- **IdP lifecycle: create disabled → configure the IdP → enable.** A new IdP is
  left off the app client, so nobody can sign in through it until an admin calls
  `POST …/{name}/enable`; `…/disable` takes it off again. Enable writes the app
  client before the row, and disable writes the row before the app client, so a
  half-finished change always leaves the IdP disabled. Delete removes it from the
  app client, then the row, then Cognito. An IdP with no row (created before Thor
  kept them) counts as disabled.
- **SAML hardening by default.** New SAML IdPs require encrypted assertions
  (Cognito's per-IdP encryption certificate is returned for the admin to load
  into their IdP) and sign their requests (`rsa-sha256`). Either can be turned
  off for an IdP that can't do it. An update that omits them keeps the current
  setting, so editing an existing IdP never silently turns encryption on or off.
- **Attribute mapping.** IdP claims can be mapped only to profile attributes
  (`email`, `given_name`, `family_name`, `name`, plus Cognito's own `username`
  mapping on OIDC IdPs), so an IdP can't set verification flags, recovery
  contacts or custom attributes. A mapping an IdP already has is accepted
  unchanged. Cognito replaces the stored mapping with the one sent on update
  (verified on dev), so a removed row is removed.
- **Roles.** A user's role is a Cognito group in the token's `cognito:groups`.
  Roles nest: Administrator (`admins`) ⊃ Analyst (`analysts`) ⊃ User (`users`).
  Thor.Api authorizes with `RequireTenantRole(minimum)`, which reads the groups
  of the token `CognitoAuthMiddleware` just re-verified, **never a header**: a
  request that bypasses API Gateway can set any header. A missing caller or no
  role group is a 403; connector tokens carry no groups. IdP management,
  service-provider info and branding require Administrator.

> **Decision — tenant comes from the credential, never the hostname.** Behind
> CloudFront → API Gateway the authorizer never sees the tenant's hostname: `Host`
> is the execute-api origin's, and any forwarded-host header is caller-controlled.
> So the authorizer resolves the tenant **only** from the verified credential (the
> Cognito pool in `iss`, a Thor-issued token's tenant claim, or an API key's stored
> binding) and reads no host or tenant header. This drops the earlier
> subdomain cross-check: a leaked credential is honored on any hostname, not only
> its own tenant's. That's accepted because the credential was always the real
> authority, and the cross-check couldn't be enforced from a trusted source.

> **Decision — Cognito M2M rejected.** Cognito `client_credentials` (M2M) was
> evaluated as the connector credential and rejected because (a) it requires a
> **publicly reachable `/oauth2/token` endpoint**, which is not acceptable here,
> and (b) **per-token-request billing** ($2.25 per 1,000 successful token
> requests) is an ongoing cost that scales with connector traffic and depends on
> every connector caching tokens correctly. Static, hashed API keys have neither
> drawback and keep full control of scoping/revocation in our data plane.

### 5.2 API key handling (decision)

- **Keys live in the Master metadata DB, not the tenant DB.** The authorizer
  already resolves tenant routing from the Master DB on every request, so
  keeping keys there makes authentication a **single lookup** and keeps tenant
  databases entirely off the hot auth path — no per-tenant RDS Proxy connection is
  opened just to check a key (avoids the connection pressure of §6.3). An API key
  is platform/edge auth material, colocated with tenant + routing metadata.
- Keys are **stored as salted hashes** — never plaintext or reversible. Format is
  `thor_{keyId}_{secret}`: `keyId` indexes the row; `secret` is verified as
  **`HMAC-SHA256(pepper, salt ‖ secret)`** with a per-key random salt and a global
  **pepper held in Secrets Manager** (§8). Comparison is constant-time. The raw
  key is shown to the customer exactly once at creation.
- Each key row carries: tenant binding, scopes, expiry, revocation, and last-used
  timestamp, and is independently revocable.
- **Tenant resolution for a key:** the presented key is looked up by its globally
  unique `keyId`, and the secret is verified against that row's hash. Only then is
  the row's stored tenant binding taken as the request's tenant. Nothing in the
  request (hostname, headers) can select or override the tenant. An unknown,
  revoked, expired or mismatched key fails closed.
- **Create/revoke API (Thor API):** a tenant-scoped API issues keys (generate
  secret, store salt + HMAC, return raw key once) and revokes them (set
  `revokedAt`). Same hashing code path (`Thor.Auth`) is shared by issuance and
  verification.

### 5.3 Presigned URL scoping (decision — tenant isolation boundary)

Presigned URLs are the **primary isolation boundary for uploads**, so URL
generation is treated as security-critical:

- The S3 key **prefix is hard-bound to the authenticated tenant**
  (`tenants/<tenantId>/uploads/...`); the caller cannot influence the tenant
  segment.
- URLs are short-lived, single-object, and constrain `content-length-range` and
  `content-type`.
- On ingestion, tenant is read back from the object key prefix and
  **re-verified** against the tenant metadata store before any processing.

**Tenant logos** (login-page branding) use the same rules with one addition:
logos are served publicly from the SPA's own origin, so nothing is served until
Thor.Api has validated it. A tenant admin PUTs to a 5-minute presigned URL under
`pending/<tenantId>/<uploadId>` in the tenant-assets bucket, a prefix CloudFront
cannot read. `PUT /v1/branding/logo` then checks the object's size (≤ 256 KB)
and leading bytes (PNG/JPEG/WebP only; never SVG, which can carry script), and
copies exactly those bytes (ETag-matched) to a fresh random key under
`tenant-assets/logos/` with the content type taken from the bytes. The frontend
distribution serves that prefix with `X-Content-Type-Options: nosniff`, the key
is recorded in `auth.tenant_branding`, and `login-config` returns it as the
tenant's `logoUrl`. A presigned PUT can't cap object size, so unpublished
uploads are deleted by a 1-day lifecycle rule.

### 5.4 Tenant resolution rules (authoritative)

| Entry point | Candidate source | Authoritative verification |
|-------------|------------------|----------------------------|
| User API request | Cognito pool in the token's `iss` → unique `tenant_routing.user_pool_id` | Token verified against that tenant's pool (issuer, JWKS signature, `token_use`, `client_id`) |
| Connector API request (Thor-issued JWT) | Token's tenant claim | Thor signature verified; tenant must exist in Master DB |
| Connector API request (API key) | `keyId` | Hashed API key in Master DB; tenant = the key's stored binding |
| S3 upload / ingestion | Object key prefix | Re-verified against tenant metadata store |

**Rule:** the candidate source only *narrows* the lookup; the request/job is
authorized only after the authoritative source confirms the same tenant. Any
mismatch fails closed and emits a security event (§10).

## 6. Data Layer

### 6.1 Stores (decision)

- **Amazon Aurora PostgreSQL Serverless v2** is the primary relational store.
- **Amazon Neptune** is the graph store, deployed as a **single regional,
  multi-AZ, tenant-partitioned** cluster following the
  [Neptune multi-tenant partition strategy](https://aws.amazon.com/blogs/database/build-multi-tenant-architectures-on-amazon-neptune/).
  Only the workflows write the graph. Thor.Api reads it, read-only (`neptune-db:ReadDataViaQuery`),
  through `Thor.Graph.IGraphRelationshipReader` for the `/accounts/{id}` and `/groups/{id}`
  relationship routes. Reads are sent as bytecode, because Neptune does not support script bindings.
  Every hop is filtered by `tenantId` as well as starting from a tenant-namespaced vertex id.
- Aurora and Neptune are each **one cluster with instances spread across AZs**,
  **not** per-AZ deployments.
  > **Reading the diagram:** `thor_architecture.png` draws Aurora and Neptune in
  > each AZ to show that instances of the *same* cluster run in both AZs for high
  > availability. It is **one Aurora cluster** (writer + reader spanning AZs) and
  > **one Neptune cluster**, not a cluster per AZ.
- **Read models** materialize expensive joins; **materialized views** answer
  analytical queries.

### 6.2 Tenancy model (decision)

- **Database-per-tenant** on a **shared Aurora cluster** to start.
- A **Master metadata DB** stores tenant metadata and **routing details**.
- **Routing resolves to `{ clusterEndpoint, databaseName, dbUser, secretRef }`,
  not just a database name.** This is the key to scaling: when a cluster shows
  contention we add another cluster and move tenants by updating routing rows —
  no application change.
- **DB users:** one read/write DB user per tenant **and** one read-only DB user
  per tenant for the Intelligence Engine. Credentials live in **Secrets
  Manager** (§8).

Scaling posture: **start with one cluster, add clusters as contention/size
grows.** The cluster-pool is expressed entirely in the routing table.

- **Cross-database references have no physical FK.** Shared, connector-level
  reference data (e.g. `master.connector_types`) lives once in the Master DB.
  Per-tenant tables that need to reference it (e.g. `source.connector_type`,
  `account.connector_type`, and the other ingestion tables' `connector_type`
  columns, plus `scan_connector_config_values.connector_type`) store the
  referenced id as a plain column with **no SQL foreign key** — Postgres
  cannot enforce a constraint across two physically separate databases.
  Referential integrity for these columns is application-level only. Within
  the Master DB itself (e.g. `authentication_type_connector_types.connector_type_id`,
  `connector_config_fields.connector_type_id` → `connector_types.id`), use a
  real FK as usual — the two tables are in the same database. This is the
  same pattern already used for `scan_connector_config_values.config_id` →
  `connector_config_fields.id`.

### 6.3 Connection management (decision)

Access is always through **RDS Proxy** to bound backend connections and survive
failovers.

Multi-tenant connection flow:

**Connection-scale note:** database-per-tenant × many ECS tasks × per-tenant
pools multiplies connections, and RDS Proxy pools per `(db, user)` pair — the
per-tenant DB user fragments proxy reuse. Mitigations: keep per-task pools small,
prefer short-lived borrow, and treat "connections per cluster" as a primary
signal for splitting to a new cluster (§6.2). See **O-3**.

### 6.4 Schema changes (decision)

Schema changes use a
[Blue/Green deployment strategy](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/whitepapers/latest/blue-green-deployments/best-practices-for-managing-data-synchronization-and-schema-changes.html)
to manage data synchronization and cut-over safely across the tenant fleet.

## 7. Compute & Orchestration

- **ECS Fargate** is the primary compute engine; **Lambda** is used for short
  tasks, ECS Fargate for long-running tasks.
- **AWS Batch** is used for large, parallelizable ingestion fan-out (manifest →
  array jobs). *(Present in the diagram; recorded here so ADR and diagram agree.)*
- **Orchestration:** every workflow uses **Step Functions** as the orchestrator
  with Lambda/ECS/Batch for compute, in a consistent module pattern.
- **Intelligence Engine** runs on ECS (Python/LangChain) and calls Bedrock.

## 8. Secrets & Encryption

- **Secrets Manager** stores all DB credentials (per-tenant RW user, per-tenant
  read-only AI user), API-key-signing material, and connector/authentication-method
  credential values (see
  [`ADR-CONNECTOR-CREDENTIAL-MANAGEMENT.md`](./ADR-CONNECTOR-CREDENTIAL-MANAGEMENT.md)).
- **Secret rotation (decision):** rotation is automated via Secrets Manager
  rotation Lambdas. Because there are N tenant secrets, rotation is staggered and
  driven off the tenant routing table so it scales with cluster count. See **O-4**.
- **KMS (decision):** all data at rest (Aurora, Neptune, S3, backups, SQS) is
  encrypted with KMS. **Per-tenant CMKs** are used where tenant-level key
  isolation / crypto-shred-on-offboarding is required (§11). BYOK is an
  evaluated option - see **O-5**.

## 9. Multi-tenant Fairness (decision)

Shared SQS + ECS + cluster means one tenant can starve others ("noisy
neighbor"). Controls:

- **Per-tenant throttling** at the edge (WAF rate rules keyed by tenant) and at
  Thor API (token-bucket per tenant).
- **Ingestion fairness:** work is partitioned per tenant so one tenant's large
  scan cannot monopolize workers; concurrency caps per tenant on Step
  Functions / Batch.
- **Backpressure & poison handling:** bounded queues, visibility-timeout tuning,
  DLQ with alarms, and idempotent consumers (§12).

## 10. Observability & Audit

- **Operational telemetry:** CloudWatch (logs/metrics), CloudWatch Alarms, and
  AWS X-Ray (tracing).

### 10.1 Application logging (decision — new)

- **Serilog via a shared bootstrap** (`Thor.Core.Logging.UseThorLogging()`,
  see [`backend/shared/Thor.Core/README.md`](../../backend/shared/Thor.Core/README.md))
  is used by every service (Thor API, Task API, and future workflow modules) so
  logging setup is consistent, while each service configures its own output
  format, level, and sinks independently via its `appsettings.json`.
- **Context enrichment is generic, not tenant-specific:** services attach
  request-scoped values (e.g. `TenantId`) to Serilog's `LogContext` via a
  configurable header-to-property middleware or an explicit push at the
  controller layer; business logic stays a plain `ILogger<T>` consumer. The
  same mechanism lets workflows enrich with `ScanId` instead once they exist.
- **Per-tenant external HTTP sink is opt-in**, resolved from a Master DB table
  (`auth.tenant_log_sink_config`) and cached like tenant routing (§6.2). It is
  wrapped in an async, batched pipeline (Serilog.Sinks.Async +
  Serilog.Sinks.Http) so resolving a tenant's endpoint and delivering to it
  never blocks the request or business-logic thread that produced the log —
  including when the endpoint or Master DB is unreachable.
- **Log levels and cost (decision):** use the level that matches the event
  (`Information` for normal events, `Warning` for expected-but-notable
  failures — e.g. the tenant-resolution mismatches called out in §5.4/§6.3 as
  emitting a security event, `Error`/`Fatal` for unhandled failures); every
  caught exception is logged, not silently swallowed. Log statements use
  structured message templates, never string interpolation, so a filtered-out
  level costs nothing — this keeps logging cheap enough to leave on in
  production without needing to reason about it per call site.
- **Audit log (decision — new):** a **tamper-evident, append-only audit store**
  records security- and tenant-relevant events (auth outcomes, tenant-resolution
  mismatches, key create/revoke, data access by the AI user, workflow outcomes,
  violation determinations). This is a first-class product concern for an
  identity-hygiene platform and is **separate from ops logs**. Audit events are
  tenant-scoped and retained per contractual/compliance requirements. See **O-6**
  for store choice (e.g., dedicated Aurora schema vs. append-only log service).
  Until that store exists, security events are written as structured log events
  with the template `Audit {AuditEvent}: …`, so they can be routed to it later.
  IdP changes emit `identity_provider.created|updated|enabled|disabled|deleted`
  with the tenant, provider, actor (Cognito `sub`) and the names of the changed
  fields, never their values.

## 11. Tenant Lifecycle (decision — new)

- **Onboarding is a manual, runbook-driven process for now** (see
  [`tenant_onboarding.md`](./tenant_onboarding.md)): create tenant DB on the
  target cluster, create RW + read-only DB users, store secrets, create Neptune
  partition, seed routing row, provision Cognito/IdP config. The runbook is
  written to be **automation-ready** (idempotent, ordered steps) so it can later
  be lifted into a Step Functions workflow without redesign.
- **Offboarding / data purge:** a governed workflow purges tenant data across
  **Aurora, Neptune, S3, and backups**, honoring **GDPR/erasure** obligations.
  Where per-tenant CMKs are used (§8), crypto-shredding the key is the primary
  erasure mechanism, with backups aging out under retention policy. See **O-7**.

## 12. Ingestion & CDC

CDC is the heart of the product. Per scan, the platform receives *n* files that
are ingested into **staging tables**, then compared against **canonical tables**
to propagate only what changed to downstream workflows.

Ingestion workflow (per diagram):

```
S3 (upload) → S3 Event → SQS → EventBridge Pipe → AWS Batch (CreateManifest / process)
            → Step Functions → (after max retries) → DLQ
```

CDC decisions:

- **Comparison is set-based, not row-by-row:** staged rows are hashed and diffed
  against canonical hashes in bulk (join on natural key), producing
  insert/update/delete sets.
- **Deletes are detected explicitly:** canonical keys absent from the current
  scan set are emitted as deletes (with a full-vs-partial scan flag so partial
  scans don't mass-delete).
- **Hash definition is explicit and versioned:** the hash covers a defined,
  ordered column set with a named algorithm (e.g., SHA-256) and a `hashVersion`
  so hash-definition changes are safe.
- **Idempotency:** every ingestion job carries an idempotency key
  (`tenant + scanId + fileId`) so DLQ redrive / retries never double-apply.
- **Ordering:** per-tenant / per-scan ordering is preserved where required
  (FIFO grouping by tenant/scan, or a scan-level sequencing guard). See **O-8**.

## 13. Intelligence Engine Data Privacy (decision — new)

- Bedrock is reached via a **VPC endpoint (PrivateLink)** so inference traffic
  stays on the AWS network and off the public internet.
- The Engine uses the **per-tenant read-only DB user** and may only read data for
  the resolved tenant.
- **PII minimization / redaction** is applied before prompts leave the VPC
  boundary; identity data sent to Bedrock is minimized to what the task needs.
- **Prompt-injection handling** and **region pinning** (data residency) are
  explicit requirements. See **O-9**.

## 14. Resilience & DR (decision — new)

- **Multi-AZ** for Aurora, Neptune, and ECS services.
- **Backups / PITR** enabled on Aurora and Neptune; S3 versioning +
  lifecycle on data buckets.
- **RPO/RTO and cross-region strategy** must be stated per environment. See
  **O-10**.

## 15. Environments & Delivery

- Separate **dev / staging / prod** environments via Terraform workspaces/modules.
- CI/CD, image scanning (ECR), and infra plan/apply gating. See **O-11**.

## 16. Workflows

Workflows are the business processes that ingest data and identify accounts,
violations, etc. Each workflow is an **independent module** that can also be a
stage in a larger pipeline. Every module follows the same pattern (queue →
orchestrator → compute → DLQ, idempotent, tenant-scoped) so new business
processes are additive.

## Open Questions

| ID | Question |
|----|----------|
| O-3 | Target **tenant count / connections-per-cluster** threshold that triggers adding a new cluster? |
| O-4 | Secret **rotation cadence** and whether rotation is zero-downtime for per-tenant users. |
| O-5 | Do we need **per-tenant CMKs / BYOK**, or is a shared KMS key acceptable for v1? |
| O-6 | **Audit store** choice, schema, and retention requirements. |
| O-7 | **Data-purge SLA** and legal/erasure requirements (GDPR, contractual). |
| O-8 | Is strict **per-tenant/per-scan ordering** required, or is idempotent out-of-order processing acceptable? |
| O-9 | Bedrock **data-residency/region** constraints and PII-redaction requirements. |
| O-10 | Target **RPO/RTO** and whether **cross-region DR** is in scope. |
| O-11 | **CI/CD** and environment-promotion strategy. |

## Changelog

- §5.1, §10.1: Thor keeps a non-secret row per tenant IdP
  (`auth.tenant_identity_provider`); IdPs are created disabled and enabled/disabled
  explicitly; SAML IdPs default to encrypted assertions and signed requests;
  attribute mapping is limited to profile attributes; IdP changes emit audit
  events.
- §5.1: Thor.Api role checks read `cognito:groups` from the token it re-verifies
  instead of the `X-THOR-CALLER-GROUPS` header; roles nest Administrator ⊃
  Analyst ⊃ User.
- §4: browsers reach the API same-origin at `<tenant>.<domain>/api/*` through the
  frontend distribution; API Gateway's CORS configuration is removed (its `ANY`
  routes sent preflights to the authorizer, which 401'd them).

- Authentication-method (connector credential) field values move from plaintext Postgres
  storage to AWS Secrets Manager — see
  [`ADR-CONNECTOR-CREDENTIAL-MANAGEMENT.md`](./ADR-CONNECTOR-CREDENTIAL-MANAGEMENT.md).
- Auth: connectors authenticate with **hashed API keys stored in the Master
  metadata DB** (moved from tenant DB), verified by a REST-API Lambda authorizer.
  Cognito M2M was evaluated and rejected (public token endpoint + per-token cost).
  Key format `thor_{keyId}_{secret}`, HMAC-SHA256 with a Secrets Manager pepper.
- Restructured into decision-oriented sections; fixed typos.
- Reconciled diagram vs. text (Aurora/Neptune single-cluster, AWS Batch, VPC Link).
- Made cluster routing (not just DB name) the scaling primitive.
- Added decisions: API-key hashing, presigned-URL scoping, audit log, tenant
  lifecycle/purge, CDC deletes/idempotency/ordering, Bedrock privacy, secret
  rotation, KMS/CMK, multi-tenant fairness, DR, environments.
- Added §10.1: application logging via shared `Thor.Core` Serilog bootstrap,
  generic context enrichment, opt-in per-tenant async/batched HTTP sink, and
  log-level/efficiency conventions.
