/// must therefore be declared always-lambda, or write that result somewhere the state machine can

/// <para><paramref name="IsInProgress"/> is for steps that poll an external job. It is advisory
/// metadata for the host; a step that needs the orchestrator to branch on it must also expose it on
/// <paramref name="Value"/>, which is what <c>OwnershipWalkResult.IsInProgress</c> does. It is
/// deliberately not mapped to a distinct process exit code — see <c>EcsHost</c>.</para>
