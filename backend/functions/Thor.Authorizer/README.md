# Thor API Gateway Lambda Authorizer

Multi-tenant AWS API Gateway REQUEST authorizer. Validates Cognito JWTs, Thor-issued connector
JWTs and tenant-issued API keys, and returns an IAM policy with a flattened context (`tenant_id`,
`caller_type`, `principal_id`, `scopes`) for the downstream API. Route-level RBAC is enforced by
the backend API, not here.

The tenant comes **only from the credential**. No `Host` or other header is read: behind
CloudFront, `Host` is the execute-api origin's, and forwarded-host headers are caller-controlled
(ADR §5):

| Credential | Tenant source |
|---|---|
| Cognito access token | Pool id in `iss` → `auth.tenant_routing.user_pool_id` (unique), then the token is verified against that pool |
| Thor-issued JWT (`iss = thor-task-api`) | The token's signature-verified tenant claim, which must exist in `auth.tenant_routing` |
| API key | The stored key record's tenant, once the secret verifies |
| Refresh token (`POST /v{n}/register/refresh` only) | The tenant of the API key the stored token was issued to; the token must exist and be unused, and the tenant must exist in `auth.tenant_routing` |

A Cognito `iss` that isn't exactly `https://cognito-idp.{region}.amazonaws.com/{region}_{id}` is
denied before any DB lookup (`CognitoIssuerParser`).

## Solution layout

- `src/Thor.Authorizer.Core` — all logic, no AWS/Lambda dependencies, fully unit-testable.
- `src/Thor.Authorizer.Function` — thin Lambda entry point + DI composition root.
- `test/Thor.Authorizer.Test` — xUnit + FluentAssertions + NSubstitute.

`Core`'s `DataAccess` layer is built against interfaces only (`ITenantRoutingRepository`,
`IApiKeyRepository`, `IRefreshTokenRepository`). Tenant routing and refresh tokens are wired to the
Master DB (`MasterDbTenantRoutingRepository`, `MasterDbRefreshTokenRepository`); the API-key store is still the in-memory fake in `CompositionRoot` until its real repository lands.

## Provisioning contracts (infra-side requirements this code assumes)

- **Credential format**: `Authorization: ApiKey {key_id}.{secret}` for API keys; a standard
  Cognito access token (JWT, optionally `Bearer `-prefixed) otherwise.
- **API key hashing**: `secret_hash` in the `tenant_api_key` table must be
  `PBKDF2-SHA256$<iterations>$<base64 hash>` (see `Pbkdf2ApiKeyHasher`). The salt is fetched from AWS Secrets Manager (see
  `SecretsManagerSaltProvider`, cached 5 min) via the `THOR_AUTHORIZER_SALT_SECRET_ID`
  environment variable, whose `SecretString` must be the base64-encoded salt bytes. The Lambda
  execution role needs `secretsmanager:GetSecretValue` on that secret — infra, not code. A
  missing/unreachable salt fails closed (Deny) for the API-key path only; the JWT path is
  unaffected.
- **Refresh tokens**: `Authorization: [Bearer ]thor_rt_{token_id}_{secret}` on
  `POST /v{n}/register/refresh`. The authorizer only looks the token id up in
  `auth.task_api_refresh_token` (must exist and not be revoked) to find its tenant — it does not
  verify the secret. Thor.Api fully verifies (hash, expiry, key status) and rotates the token.
  `thor_authorizer` needs the column grants in `db-roles.sql`.
- **Gateway Response mapping**: this Lambda can only return a bare IAM policy Deny (API Gateway
  defaults that to a 403). Shaping it into a 401 + JSON body requires a Gateway Response mapping
  configured in API Gateway — infra, not code.
