/// <remarks>
/// Inputs are the tenant's onboarding details (supplied at StartExecution). Everything
/// else is produced by the steps — the tenant database, its IAM DB-user (role) names, and
/// the Cognito ids. Cluster endpoint and region are environment config (not per-tenant),
/// so they are injected into the steps that need them, not carried here. There are no DB
/// credentials anywhere: the roles are IAM-auth, and the Cognito admin password comes from
/// the invite flow.
