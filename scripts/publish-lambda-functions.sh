# Publishes each backend/functions/<Name>'s Lambda entry point into its own publish/ dir — Terraform can only
# zip files, not compile C#. Run by root.hcl's before_hook on every terragrunt plan/apply/destroy. The entry
# point is whichever *.csproj under <Name>/src/ (any depth) has <AWSProjectType>Lambda</AWSProjectType>; a plain
# library like Core has no such marker and is skipped — its ProjectReference gets pulled in automatically anyway.
#
# backend/workflows is deliberately NOT scanned. Every workflow module ships as a container image, and its
# Lambdas are that same image (package_type = "Image"), so none of them needs a zip. The last exception,
# Thor.Workflows.IngestionDriver, became THOR_STEP=select-compute inside the ingestion image.
# Skips a rebuild if src/ + backend/shared/ + global.json are unchanged (local .publish-hash), else falls through
# to a per-function JFrog cache (JFROG_LAMBDA_ARTIFACTS_REPOSITORY, keyed by content hash) before a real dotnet
# publish. Hash excludes bin/obj and lives outside publish/ so it isn't zipped into the deployed package.
#
# TenantDbContext's migration is regenerated from scratch here, every run, rather than committed — org policy
# prohibits committing generated/tool-output code. This is safe only because every tenant database is brand
# new and empty when this migration is applied (see CreateTenantTablesStep) — there's never a prior schema or
# history-table entry to conflict with.
#
# MasterDbContext's Migrations/Master/ is NOT regenerated here — it stays committed, deliberately, as a
# carved-out exception to that policy. Master DB is one long-lived, already-populated database per
# environment; Thor.DbBootstrap.Function.MigrateAsync()s against it directly. Regenerating "from scratch" the
# way Tenant does would mint a migration with a new ID unrelated to what's in that live database's
# __EFMigrationsHistory table, so MigrateAsync would try to re-run CREATE TABLE against tables that already
# exist — breaking the bootstrap Lambda against any already-provisioned environment. See
# backend/shared/Thor.DataLayer/README.md.
